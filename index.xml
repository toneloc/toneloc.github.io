      <description>I take issue here with the notion of presentient and nearly deific artificial intelligences who shall, it is supposed, be programmed to achieve at all costs a &amp;ldquo;supergoal&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; only later to wreak accidental havoc on their hapless human inventors.
Consider a specific incarnation of the idea: the meme of the paper clip-maximizing super AI, popularized by Oxford University&amp;rsquo;s Prof. Nick Bostrom. It &amp;ldquo;seems perfectly possible,&amp;rdquo; writes Bostrom, &amp;ldquo;to have a superintelligence whose sole goal is something completely arbitrary, such as to manufacture as many paperclips as possible, and who would resist with all its might any attempt to alter this goal.</description>

      <description>Dear reader,
Thanks for visiting my blog and welcome. I plan to write about economic history, art, the history of ideas, crypto systems, and whatever else comes to mind. Feel free to contact me @tonklaus.
Special thanks to the author of this useful tutorial about creating websites with Hugo, a Go app that generates static websites like this one.
Cheers, Tony</description>
