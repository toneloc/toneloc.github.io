      <description>Idea #1: Sell life insurance via a mobile app to the young and healthy Warren Buffett counts the among the economic pillars of Berkshire Hathaway several insurance companies, GEICO and Gen Re prominent among them. For decades, Buffet has enjoyed the free cash flow these insurance premia rake in. And from as early as 1967, Buffett was acquiring such obscure insurance agencies as National Indemnity Insurance and National Fire and Marine Insurance have provided to spin the Twentieth Century&amp;rsquo;s most impressive financial flywheel.</description>

      <description>In Obermaier&amp;rsquo;s the Panama Papers, an amusing anecdote
In the late 1990s, Joachim zu Baldernach &amp;ndash; who&amp;rsquo;s not really called that &amp;ndash; finds himself unable to locate his Bahamas-based company. Strictly speaking, Baldernach, wh comes from a familty of billionaires, hasn&amp;rsquo;t actually misplaced the company, but rather the anonymous bearer share for all 5,000 shares of the shell company, which was established in the 1990s. But the bearer share is, effectively, the company.</description>

      <description>Karl Popper&amp;rsquo;s intellectual achievements lie mostly in his twofold defense of human reasonableness. Notice that I did not use the term often associated with Popper, &amp;ldquo;raionality&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;critical rationality.&amp;rdquo;
The first leg of his defense is his vivid description and defense of the Open Society, in the eponymous book published 1945. Popper framed the values that
He achieved widespread fame upon publishing The Open Society and Its Discontents in 1945. Popper notes that what &amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <title>Letter on tokenization</title>

      <description>The promise of tokenization is a exciting prospect in the blockchain space. Organizations such as the DAO and various ICOs highlight the trend, having enjoyed eye-poppingly large funding rounds on dubious credentials. We may tsk-tsk this speculation, but if ICOs foretell what truly global and unfettered capital markets will look like &amp;hellip; then it&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome. From the seeds of speculation, may great ideas and products flourish! And the beneficiaries of a half-trillion dollar crypto windfall can send their bits to whomever they please.</description>

      <title>Wallace Stevens, the Poet Laureate of Bitcoin</title>

      <description>Should there be a Poet Laureate of Bitcoin, the great modernist Wallace Stevens of Hartford, Connecticut, USA (1877-1955) would surely be a top candidate. For those who will say that cryptography isn&amp;rsquo;t enough alike poetry to warrant an official poet of it, channel your inner poet for moment and let your imagination roam &amp;hellip;
Because, you see, Mr. Stevens was a special case. He was at once astonishingly imaginative and disciplined and practical.</description>

      <title>No Sports</title>

      <description>I remember some years ago meeting a programmer who made a remark about how different a world we would have if there weren&amp;rsquo;t any sports. &amp;ldquo;Imagine what we could accomplish when we used the money and energy from sports in more important areas like health and education,&amp;rdquo; he said.
I objected to his premise, arguing that sports was innately human. I had in mind the thought that if a world without sports and games existed, then a world without humans must be such a conclusion&amp;rsquo;s distopian prerequisite.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Fallacy of Paper Clip Maximizing-Robots and Supergoals</title>

      <description>I take issue here with the notion of presentient and nearly deific artificial intelligences who shall, it is supposed, be programmed to achieve at all costs a &amp;ldquo;supergoal&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; only later to wreak accidental havoc on their hapless human inventors.
Consider a specific incarnation of the idea: the meme of the paper clip-maximizing super AI, popularized by Oxford University&amp;rsquo;s Prof. Nick Bostrom. It &amp;ldquo;seems perfectly possible,&amp;rdquo; writes Bostrom, &amp;ldquo;to have a superintelligence whose sole goal is something completely arbitrary, such as to manufacture as many paperclips as possible, and who would resist with all its might any attempt to alter this goal.</description>

      <description>Dear reader,
Thanks for visiting my blog and welcome. I plan to write about economic history, art, the history of ideas, crypto systems, and whatever else comes to mind. Feel free to contact me @tonklaus.
Special thanks to the author of this useful tutorial about creating websites with Hugo, a Go app that generates static websites like this one.
Cheers, Tony</description>
