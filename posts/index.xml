      <title>Bitcoin as Digital Picassos</title>

      <description>One of the easiest and cleverest ways, I reckon, to describe the cryptocurrency phenomenon to neophytes is to liken its remarkable run-up in value to the likewise remarkable run-up in value of Picasso paintings.
Just a couple of months ago, Picasso’s Femme au béret et à la robe quadrillée (Translation: “Woman in beret and checkered dress”) went for $69 million at Sotheby’s. Recent years have seen Gauguins and Cezannes command several hundred million dollars at auction.</description>

      <title>Setting up Local Bitcoin and Ethereum Nodes on a Dedicated Linux Machine</title>

      <description>In my experience, to properly interrogate the bitcoin or ethereum blockchain, network, and all their associated programs and scripts, it is best to dedicate a standalone Linux machine. These programs require a lot of horsepower, storage, and network capacity. Often they must run uninterrupted for hours or days at a time. For these reasons, a dedicated computer is advisable.
Also, as public blockchain projects come from the Linux open source lineage, Linux will be the easiest way to run a full node and interact with the latest and greatest features of cryptographic and networking technology, like homomorphic encryption techniques and the Lightning network.</description>

      <title>Sir Karl Popper and the Unended Quest for the Open Society</title>

      <description>Populists through the ages have used rhetoric to its most horrific effects, swapping truths for untruths, discourse for edict, and peace for coercion. Resisting the bully&amp;rsquo;s dastardly proclivities and undergirding the foundations of a free and open society are those who affirm the principles of democratic free speech, respect for others in the search of truth, and the formal scientific method. One of those intellectuals who resisted the tempting aura of the authoritarianism, central planning, and Fabian socialism in Britain and, to a lesser extent, the United States in the mid-20th Century was the great Austrian philosopher of science, Sir Karl Popper, who was a professor for many years at University College London.</description>

      <description>Idea #1: Sell life insurance via a mobile app to the young and healthy Warren Buffett counts the among the economic pillars of Berkshire Hathaway several insurance companies, GEICO and Gen Re prominent among them. For decades, Buffet has enjoyed the free cash flow these insurance premia rake in. And from as early as 1967, Buffett was acquiring such obscure insurance agencies as National Indemnity Insurance and National Fire and Marine Insurance have provided to spin the Twentieth Century&amp;rsquo;s most impressive financial flywheel.</description>

      <title>Letter on tokenization</title>

      <description>The promise of tokenization is a exciting prospect in the blockchain space. Organizations such as the DAO and various ICOs highlight the trend, having enjoyed eye-poppingly large funding rounds on dubious credentials. We may tsk-tsk this speculation, but if ICOs foretell what truly global and unfettered capital markets will look like &amp;hellip; then it&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome. From the seeds of speculation, may great ideas and products flourish! And the beneficiaries of a half-trillion dollar crypto windfall can send their bits to whomever they please.</description>

      <title>Wallace Stevens, the Poet Laureate of Bitcoin</title>

      <description>Should there be a Poet Laureate of Bitcoin, the great modernist Wallace Stevens of Hartford, Connecticut, USA (1877-1955) would surely be a top candidate. For those who will say that cryptography isn&amp;rsquo;t enough alike poetry to warrant an official poet of it, channel your inner poet for moment and let your imagination roam &amp;hellip;
Because, you see, Mr. Stevens was a special case. He was at once astonishingly imaginative and disciplined and practical.</description>

      <title>No Sports</title>

      <description>I remember some years ago meeting a programmer who made a remark about how different a world we would have if there weren&amp;rsquo;t any sports. &amp;ldquo;Imagine what we could accomplish when we used the money and energy from sports in more important areas like health and education,&amp;rdquo; he said.
I objected to his premise, arguing that sports was innately human. I had in mind the thought that if a world without sports and games existed, then a world without humans must be such a conclusion&amp;rsquo;s distopian prerequisite.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Fallacy of Paper Clip Maximizing-Robots and Supergoals</title>

      <description>I take issue here with the notion of presentient and nearly deific artificial intelligences who shall, it is supposed, be programmed to achieve at all costs a &amp;ldquo;supergoal&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; only later to wreak accidental havoc on their hapless human inventors.
Consider a specific incarnation of the idea: the meme of the paper clip-maximizing super AI, popularized by Oxford University&amp;rsquo;s Prof. Nick Bostrom. It &amp;ldquo;seems perfectly possible,&amp;rdquo; writes Bostrom, &amp;ldquo;to have a superintelligence whose sole goal is something completely arbitrary, such as to manufacture as many paperclips as possible, and who would resist with all its might any attempt to alter this goal.</description>

      <description>Dear reader,
Thanks for visiting my blog and welcome. I plan to write about economic history, art, the history of ideas, crypto systems, and whatever else comes to mind. Feel free to contact me @tonklaus.
Special thanks to the author of this useful tutorial about creating websites with Hugo, a Go app that generates static websites like this one.
Cheers, Tony</description>
