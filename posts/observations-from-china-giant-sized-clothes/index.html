  <p>Like many Americans, I&rsquo;ll admit I was intimidated by the idea of visiting China. For starters there&rsquo;s the distance—a twelve-hour slug across the Pacific. That&rsquo;s twelve long hours of cold rolls and a stiff back.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s those annoying prerogatives of the state bureaucracy: visa restrictions, limits on where you can go as a tourist in China, and various proofs of personhood and plans. And for the technologically mindful, in China 2025 there is the reality of digital surveillance.</p>
<p>But China actually loosened its visa policies for Americans this year. Before summer 2025, you could only stay for one week on a transit or tourist visa. But since COVID lockdowns—which were the most severe in China—tourism has been flagging. So now American tourists can stay up to 10 days and are not limited to one province, as previously.</p>
<p>This rule change and a speaking engagement in Taiwan saw me on a sixteen-hour-er from Dallas to Shanghai. I had read some about China, but I still couldn&rsquo;t have named more than two or three of the dynasties. Ming? Qing? When I mentioned I was going to China, a family member wondered if I meant China One, the Chinese joint in town.</p>
<p>But I had an overriding desire to see the Middle Kingdom with my own eyes, the Communist State, the factory of the world. The Orient. I was prepared to be impressed. The plan was to visit an old friend in Shanghai, then take the high-speed train 2,000 miles (3,200 km) across the country to Yunnan Province, that mountainous, ethnically varied, canyoned southwest region over by Myanmar, Laos, and Tibet.</p>
<h3 id="humming-along">Humming Along</h3>
<p>And so the Chinese immigration duty officer asked me what I was doing in China: &ldquo;Tourism,&rdquo; I muttered, innocent enough. He scanned my passport, fingerprinted me, and the digital apparatus churned for four minutes while I stood there silently. Then—boom-sticker-stamp—I was in Shanghai.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always deeply inspiring getting that first breath of fresh air in a new land, stepping out of the terminal, after a day in sterile plastic airports and planes. One is struck with the sudden desire to take flight himself. Or so I felt that cool dark December evening.</p>
<p>Maybe 2 out of 3 cars in Shanghai is an electric vehicle. You can tell which ones by the lime green license plates. Those electric vehicles, they don&rsquo;t gargle like gas engines. Instead they zim and zum and hum. The relative quiet is rather disarming.</p>
<p><img src="/china-shanghai-skyscraper.jpeg" alt="Modern Shanghai skyscraper towering above">
<em>The vast scale of Shanghai&rsquo;s sleek modern architecture</em></p>
<p>Shanghai is quiet, clean, tame, and most of all … expansive. They say everything is bigger in Texas, and that may be true—until you get to China.  Riding across Shanghai in a cheap rideshare, the otherworldly shapes of the vast infrastructure take hold: enormous bridges, skyscrapers, highways spiraling up like huge Slinkies stretched up to the sky.</p>
<p>Shanghai has 25 million souls, and the city authorities want scoot them from one place to another with the greatest efficiency. They are doing a great job at that. There are so many new subway lines opening up that the residents can&rsquo;t keep track of them. From the city&rsquo;s skyscrapers, it seemed like the city sprawls down the curve of the earth … thousands of years, billions of people. The world&rsquo;s wildest permutations of story and experience.</p>
<p><img src="/china-shanghai-bund.jpeg" alt="View from Shanghai observation deck overlooking the city and river">
<em>The Bund was once held trading houses from all the Western powers, a gateway to commerce in China.</em></p>
<h3 id="those-cities-youve-never-heard-of-population-10-million">Those Cities You&rsquo;ve Never Heard Of (Population 10 Million)</h3>
<p>The vastness of China was best displayed on my train trip from Shanghai to Kunming. We first stopped in Hangzhou (population 12 million), home of DeepSeek and the tech ecosystem. Next came Nanchang (population 6 million), Changsha (10 million), Huaihua (5 million), Guiyang (6 million), and finally, Kunming (9 million). I had heard of two of them.</p>
<p><img src="/china-train-view-cityscape.jpeg" alt="View from the train window showing cityscape and river">
<em>Dozens of huge residential buildings in Changsha. Anybody in there?</em></p>
<p>China reminds me of the father who bought his small child adult-sized clothes hoping she will grow into them. &ldquo;She will need these when she is an adult,&rdquo; he says, self-assured. Of course she will wear clothes, who can deny that. But will these clothes fit her? Will she like them? What if she doesn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Everywhere in China there are not just adult-sized clothes, but giant-sized clothes. Huge apartment complexes. Vast flowing rivers, upon which ocean-faring container ships can travel inland on the Yangtze 1,000 miles to Wuhan (population 15 million) and Chongqing (population 32 million). There are more than four times the navigable waterways in China than the United States.</p>
<p><img src="/china-yunnan-mountain-bridge.jpeg" alt="Suspension bridge spanning a river valley in Yunnan mountains">

<p>Earth&rsquo;s highest mountains are in China. China&rsquo;s landmass is larger than the United States&rsquo;. The scale of China&rsquo;s high-speed rail network is without parallel. There are huge piles of food everywhere and 10-lane roads—not highways—that look like they&rsquo;re still steaming and oily from the paving machines.</p>
<p>The train stations are shaped like gigantic Kleenex boxes, horseshoed on the inside with chain noodle restaurants and 7-Elevens. The trains go 200 miles (300 kilometers) per hour. China uses 56% of the world&rsquo;s coal power and now consumes 30% more electricity per capita than Europe. It is the factory of the world.</p>
<p><img src="/china-train-station-crowds.jpeg" alt="Massive train station filled with crowds of travelers">
<em>The Shanghai High Speed Rail Station</em></p>
<p>China is immensely plugged in, to the grid and to the Internet. One annoying thing as an American in China was that all of the smartphone apps were different. There is the Chinese Uber (Didi), the Chinese Google Maps (Dianping), and the Chinese Venmo (Alipay). Setting the language to &ldquo;English&rdquo; on these apps rendered little help. My photos were littered with screenshots for the translation app.</p>
<p>One night in Kuning i stayed in a Howard Johnson hotel that must have been four or five stars. It cost me $50 and there was hardly another soul in there. In the morning I went down to the vast gym in the basement. There was no one there, completely dark and cold. &ldquo;Does this place make any money?&rdquo; I thought to myself, as a hotel employee tried in vain to find the correct electrical circuit for the treadmills.</p>
<h3 id="the-process-of-civilization">The Process of Civilization</h3>
<p>China is a great civilization, so I was prepared to be impressed. The social order was almost palpable. I saw very few homeless people or beggars, no gay couples holding hands, and no one propositioning me—a conspicuously tall white Westerner—for drugs or women. No one really paid me much attention; people in China were heads-down, minding their own business.</p>
<p>China was very impressive. Everything was either five years old or five hundred. It was humbling to realize how vast across time and place human civilization is.</p>
<p><img src="/china-starbucks-traditional-architecture.jpeg" alt="Traditional Chinese architecture housing a Starbucks">
<em>Starbucks in traditional Chinese architecture</em></p>
<p>But one thing China lacked, in my opinion, was finesse and marketing. There was not the ease of movement, of sales, of advertising, communication, and storytelling. The Chinese are not about polish so much as elbow grease. The service was often hesitant and confused. China needs to work on soft skills like branding, marketing, sales &hellip; sex appeal.</p>
<p>Lijiang Old Town was one place in China which understood tourism as an industry. This UNESCO World Heritage site in Yunnan Province has been perfectly manicured for the tourist yuan.</p>
<p><img src="/china-street-shops.jpeg" alt="Cobblestone street in Lijiang Old Town with traditional architecture"></p>
<ul>
<li>Old Town—ancient architecture meets modern tourism infrastructure*</li>
</ul>
<p>The old town is a maze of cobblestone streets, wooden houses with curved tile roofs, and canals running through it all. Every surface has been polished, every storefront optimized for Instagram. Traditional Naxi minority architecture, jewelry stores, and endless shops selling the same tie-dyed scarves and silver bracelets. It was ruly beatufiul.</p>
<p><img src="/china-lijiang-old-town.jpeg" alt="Traditional buildings and shops lining a narrow street in Lijiang">
<em>The picturesque streets of Lijiang—perfectly preserved, perfectly commercialized</em></p>
<p>When the topic of politics even remotely entered the conversation, it felt as if the conversation had entered a black hole. Why go in there if there&rsquo;s nothing to find?</p>
<p>People were mostly very shy. Of the few folks that I spoke with who spoke decent English, any time the conversation veered toward the political, they would demur. What was interesting is that it didn&rsquo;t feel like a conscious evasion. Perhaps it was and I am not seasoned in the intricacies of Chinese conversation. But the feeling I got is that an alternative political arrangement, even mild political disagreement, literally does not cross the mind.</p>
<p>Is it what the people want? How could you tell? Suppression of human rights for the greater good—is it what people want? Choice and consent seem absent from the equation.</p>
<p>Those who champion the state-led growth of China conveniently fail to mention that from Wuhan came the most disastrous things to ever come from centralized governments: COVID-19, born in the Wuhan Institute for Virology, and consequently strict lockdowns, born in Beijing.</p>
<p>Taiwan was messier, grittier. It wasn&rsquo;t sleek and gleaming. Freedom is often ugly. Democracy is sloppy. Hunter S. Thompson said America was a nation &ldquo;of 220 million used car salesmen.&rdquo; Going to the used car lot was what it felt like entering Taiwan after China.</p>

<p>Taiwan felt like a mashup of Japan and China. That makes sense because it was ruled by Japan from 1899 to 1945.</p>
<p>The electric vehicle infrastructure was remarkable. The food was all right—I had better food experiences in Malaysia and Japan. The scale of everything was breathtaking. Worlds within worlds.</p>

China is a civilization that has built adult-sized clothes for itself. Whether the country will grow into them comfortably, whether the people will truly like wearing them. That remains to be seen.</p>
