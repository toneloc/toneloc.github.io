      <description>Populists through the ages have used rhetoric to its most horrific effects, swapping truths for untruths, discourse for edict, and peace for coercion. Resisting the bully&amp;rsquo;s dastardly proclivities and undergirding the foundations of a free and open society are those who affirm the principles of democratic free speech, respect for others in the search of truth, and the formal scientific method. One of those intellectuals who resisted the tempting aura of the authoritarianism, central planning, and Fabian socialism in Britain and, to a lesser extent, the United States in the mid-20th Century was the great Austrian philosopher of science, Sir Karl Popper, who was a professor for many years at University College London.</description>

      <title>Letter on tokenization</title>

      <description>The promise of tokenization is a exciting prospect in the blockchain space. Organizations such as the DAO and various ICOs highlight the trend, having enjoyed eye-poppingly large funding rounds on dubious credentials. We may tsk-tsk this speculation, but if ICOs foretell what truly global and unfettered capital markets will look like &amp;hellip; then it&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome. From the seeds of speculation, may great ideas and products flourish! And the beneficiaries of a half-trillion dollar crypto windfall can send their bits to whomever they please.</description>

      <title>Wallace Stevens, the Poet Laureate of Bitcoin</title>

      <description>Should there be a Poet Laureate of Bitcoin, the great modernist Wallace Stevens of Hartford, Connecticut, USA (1877-1955) would surely be a top candidate. For those who will say that cryptography isn&amp;rsquo;t enough alike poetry to warrant an official poet of it, channel your inner poet for moment and let your imagination roam &amp;hellip;
Because, you see, Mr. Stevens was a special case. He was at once astonishingly imaginative and disciplined and practical.</description>

      <title>No Sports</title>

      <description>I remember some years ago meeting a programmer who made a remark about how different a world we would have if there weren&amp;rsquo;t any sports. &amp;ldquo;Imagine what we could accomplish when we used the money and energy from sports in more important areas like health and education,&amp;rdquo; he said.
I objected to his premise, arguing that sports was innately human. I had in mind the thought that if a world without sports and games existed, then a world without humans must be such a conclusion&amp;rsquo;s distopian prerequisite.</description>
