      <description>One of the easiest and cleverest ways, I reckon, to describe the cryptocurrency phenomenon to neophytes is to liken its remarkable run-up in value to the likewise remarkable run-up in value of Picasso paintings.
Just a couple of months ago, Picasso’s Femme au béret et à la robe quadrillée (Translation: “Woman in beret and checkered dress”) went for $69 million at Sotheby’s. Recent years have seen Gauguins and Cezannes command several hundred million dollars at auction.</description>

      <description>The promise of tokenization is a exciting prospect in the blockchain space. Organizations such as the DAO and various ICOs highlight the trend, having enjoyed eye-poppingly large funding rounds on dubious credentials. We may tsk-tsk this speculation, but if ICOs foretell what truly global and unfettered capital markets will look like &amp;hellip; then it&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome. From the seeds of speculation, may great ideas and products flourish! And the beneficiaries of a half-trillion dollar crypto windfall can send their bits to whomever they please.</description>

      <description>Should there be a Poet Laureate of Bitcoin, the great modernist Wallace Stevens of Hartford, Connecticut, USA (1877-1955) would surely be a top candidate. For those who will say that cryptography isn&amp;rsquo;t enough alike poetry to warrant an official poet of it, channel your inner poet for moment and let your imagination roam &amp;hellip;
Because, you see, Mr. Stevens was a special case. He was at once astonishingly imaginative and disciplined and practical.</description>
