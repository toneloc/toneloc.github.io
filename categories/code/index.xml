      <description>Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s volatility scares away many investors, which makes sense. If you bought BTC in late 2017, you would be sitting in a deep financial hole for the entirety, so far, of 2018. But te late 2017 run-up subsided quickly, as did the spike in late 2013.

These programs require a lot of horsepower, storage, and network capacity. Often they must run uninterrupted for hours or days at a time. For these reasons, a dedicated computer is advisable.
Also, as public blockchain projects come from the Linux open source lineage, Linux will be the easiest way to run a full node and interact with the latest and greatest features of cryptographic and networking technology, like homomorphic encryption techniques and the Lightning network.</description>
