I'm a Chicago-based software developer interested in economic history, art, freedom of expression, and cryptographic systems. 

Here are few websites I've built: [etherolympics.com](https://etherolympics.com), [multisig.it](https://multisig.it), [tweetwallet.com](https://tweetwallet.com). This work is all open source (on my GitHub)[https://github.com/toneloc]. And below are a some of my writings.
