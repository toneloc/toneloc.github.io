I'm a US-based software developer interested in economic history, art, freedom of expression, and bitcoin. 

My work has been sponsored by [OpenSats](https://opensats.org/) and the [Human Rights Foundation](https://hrf.org/).

Find my open-source work, including [Stable Channels](https://stablechannels.com), peer-to-peer dollar balances on the bitcoin Lightning network, on my [GitHub](https://github.com/toneloc).
