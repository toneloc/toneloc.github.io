I'm a US-based software developer interested in economic history, freedom of expression, art, and bitcoin. 

I used to work in tech at big banks where my team and I built [JP Morgan's Digital Assets trading network](https://www.jpmorgan.com/kinexys/digital-assets).

Now I work on open-source projects in the bitcoin ecosystem, including [Stable Channels](https://stablechannels.com), peer-to-peer dollar balances on the bitcoin Lightning network

My work has been sponsored by [Open Sats](https://opensats.org/) and the [Human Rights Foundation](https://hrf.org/).

You can find my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/toneloc).
