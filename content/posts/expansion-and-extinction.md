<h1>Extinction vs. Expansion </h1>

A recent bestseller, which I have not read, is called "The Sixth Extinction." The term "The Sixth Extinction" refers to the rapid increase in the extinction of species due to human activity, especially during the last 50 years. Previous species dead of rather more natural causes, such as the Ice Ages (the fifth extinction), gigantic bursts from volcanoes (the fourth extinction), or some other of the disatrous physical calamity periodically pummels Mother Earth. 

In the avobook, we learn that as much as 99.9% of all species which have ever lived, are now extinct. 

Which world would you rather live in? The world where



If, however we were to spoil our chances at enabling this excellent world, perhaps we tread carefully, hence conservatism again.

People are what matter most. 






Deflation is, always and everywhere, a bad thing. 

Keynesianism proposes increasing the growth rate at all costs, while environmentalism stresses limits to growth. 

Here we find an interesting concern for Keynes: Keynes was willing to spend drastically to help those here and now.

In 2018, however, it's not evident t

It's interesting to me that we might call Keynes a techno-utopian. Having predicted that we would live to age 300 and work four hours a week, Keynes was confident that the inventive mind and the exponential improvment in human well-being could outstrip physical limitations to growth. 

William Baumol, per usual, gets to the heart of the matter. In cost-benefit analysis, the rather aspirational study of tallying the costs and benefits of various governmental interventions, the concept of a social discount rate is employed in order to best weigh the benefit of future generations against today.


Environmentalists, we would presume would favor a very low social discount rate. That is, if

Stimulating Consumption vs. Normalizing Resumption

As hinted above, environmentalism should be a rather rotund policy position insofar as it overlaps with a lot of others: you may find 


Having a lot of credit and borrowing in the financial system means there is more activity in the economy, no doubt, but it also means more stuff. Cheaper financing yields more SUVs; cheaper mortgages yield more McMansions; and cheaper borrowing means more appliances, air travel, plastics, and products. 


Consumption is good, claim the Keynesians. We need to make do with less, claim the environmentalists. 


Keynesians infamously argue that it it better to pay a worker to fill in a ditch

Spending at the bottom of the business cycle, it seems to me, exacerabates the problem: even though there is evidently too much stuff in the economy, we outh
