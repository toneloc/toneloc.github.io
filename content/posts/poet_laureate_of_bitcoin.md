Should there exist an office of the poet laureate of bitcoin, the great modernist Wallace Stevens of Hartford, Connecticut, USA (1877-1955) would surely be a top candidate.

Many will object that cryptography isn't enough alike poetry to warrant an official poet of it. Yet Mr. Stevens was a special case; he lived an astonishing, imaginative, and practical life. He was at once a compound word a spliced wire. His character, in its peculiar way, was similar to bitcoin inventor(s) Sathosi Nakamoto's. 

For consider some basic facts above Stevens, like that in addition to winning the National Book Award for his 1951 collection *The Auroras of Autumn*, and in addtion to his 1955 Pultizer Prize, Stevens also enjoyed a thirty-year career as in-house attorney for an insurance company. 

At his day job at The Hartford Accident and Indemnity Corporation, Stevens assessed casualty insurance claims. With this type of insurance, a large organization may insures against the failure of a contractor to perform. For example, the State of Illinois may get casualty insurance that pays out if a contracted contstruction company doesn't build a bridge over the Chicago River. 

Off the clock, away from workaday corporate live of Stevens-the-claims-assessor, Stevens=the-poet let words and ideas fly. Stevens' style is characterized by "an extraordinary vocabulary, a flair for memorable phrasing, an accomplished sense of imagery, and the ability to both lampoon and philosophize." [] His poetic themes were, for the most part, pretty consistent. He penned richly textured ruminations about the nature of art, about creativity, and about death. His poetry considered imagination and aesthetics as life experience itself. 

A common motif was the "Supreme Fiction", a post-reliious intimiation at the ultimate reality, "known to be fiction but imagined to be real." His poetry was perhaps most famed most for the difficulty readers may face when unpacking his dense, abstruse and head-scratching stanzas. Stevens midn was alive with thrilling run-on sentences, and marvelously compounded trains of thought. Steven said that for the poet "the imagination is paramount, and ... he dwells apart in his imagination, as the philosopher dwells in his reason, and as the priest dwells in his belief ..." What is so interestin is that Stevens presumably found such time for "dwelling in his imagination" while away from his desk at The Hartford. 

Stevens' impressive moonlighting efforts is a key point in favorably comparing him with another prodigious dilletante, Satoshi Nakamoto. Both designed complicated systems of ideas while away from their day jobs (presumably). Both were brave and remarkably novel with their ideas. Perhaps most importantly, both were persistent in their efforts. Both found thematic influence in the academic gains of prior minds. And most of all, both had a deep belief, as Stevens put it, in "the power of the mind over the possibility of things.""

Incongrously, hardly ever did Stevens-as-poet interface with Stevens-as-claims-assessor. Hardly ever does money or technology or business feature as a theme in his poetry or essays. In a later essay, Stevens would once call money “a kind of poetry," but cared not to elaborate. While he did think a lot about "value" and even penned an essay, "Imagination as Value", Stevens in the essay takes ironic care not even to mention the idea of economic value. 

Despite excelling in vastly different disciplines, there are analogous mental models between Stevens and Satoshi. In the cryptoeconomic world, there is an ideological jump of faith to be made -- that of accepting the subjective value of money --- for the entire enterprise of to make any sense. I consider, bluntly, the economic ananlogue of Stevens' "Supreme Fiction". In a similar vein, Nakamato suggests that we imgine a boring metal that (1) and (2) "somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason". Nakamoto hints here, akin to Stevens, at an agnosticity over the aqcuisition of value. Both authors here have an innate understanding of the role of individual imagination in shaping the reality of our times. "We live in the mind," says Stevens, and "if we live in the mind, we live with the imagination." Nakamoto might very well agree. 

*NY Times*reporter Quentin Hardy first pointed that acquaintance in my mind. As he points out:

>The poet Wallace Stevens called money “a kind of poetry.” He also had the horse sense to write his verses about the romance of the human imagination while walking to his job as a vice president for an insurance company. He knew both sides of the coin, when he said how closely the real and the imaginary need each other for society to work. []

However incongrously the comparison may at first seeem, crypto enthusiasts should recognize just how very much a role the imagination has played in the development of the ecosystem fo cryptocurrency. Admitting Mr. Stevens to the serve as

Finally, while both parties are immensely accomplished it should be noted, finally, that both seem to caution us not to fall into the myth of the great inventor. Stevens was not a humble man, but In *Notes Towards a Supreme Fiction*, Stevens asks us not to "suppose an inventing mind as source / Of this idea nor for that mind compose / A voluminous master". The conspicuously annoymous persona of Satoshi may also ask us not "compose a voluminous master" onto any inventing mind, noting instead that rich and immortal systems of ideas in poetry or cyrptography are built upon by prior minds too.
