Permit me the liberty to propose for consideration to the post of *Poet Laureate of Bitcoin*, Mr. Wallace Stevens of Hartford, Connecticut (1877-1955). 

Opponents to the very nature of a Poet Laureate of Bitcoin may be inclined at once to object. After all, the cynic might argue, on the tree of human knowledge, the realms of poetry and cryptography as far apart as twelth cousins, thrice removed. No stident objections here.

Yet. There is something about Mr. Stevens and the deeply hidden meaning in his poems that leads me to believe that cryptographic systems and poetic license are closer than we suppose. 

Consider: Wallace Steves, the great American modernist, was a scribbler of richly textured ruminations on the nature of art and the imagination. In his lifetime he achieved widespread recognition, a Pulizter Prize, and the National Poetry Prize. He was famed for his abstrusity, his poetic reactions to the industrial and nuclear age, and head-scratching stanzas like this:

    There is a project for the sun. The sun
    Must bear no name, gold flourisher, but be
    In the difficulty of what it is to be.

Perhaps most surprising was Stevens' long workaday career as in-house attorney for an insurance company, The Hartford Accident and Indemnity Corporation, during the dynamic first half of the American Twentieth Century. That's right, Stevens created such a rich and evocative system of abstract ideas while also maintaining an entirely unrelated, mundane career as a nationally renowned assesor claims on surety bonds. [1] 

Stevens impressive moonlighting efforts and rich system of ideas have something in common with another dilletantish and nonprofessional creator(s), Satoshi Nakamoto, inventor(s) of the Bitcoin protocol. The creators of Bitcoin and historic code-breaker and code-makers lived, or live, in the constructive world of ideas. The likes of Turing, Hellman, Diffie, and Rivest have immense imagination applied to practical matters; it's their imagination, coupled with their hard work, that has stirred us to care about their work. 

Stevens cautions us not to fall into the myth of the great inventor: in *Notes Towards a Supreme Fiction*, to "Never suppose an inventing mind as source / Of this idea nor for that mind compose / A voluminous master". Stevens supposes that the ideas are already out there in the open, ready for the taking. We live in a rich world of ideas, shaped by our mind and the minds of generations who have come before us. Ethics and resposibility does not live in our mind, as rationalists may claim, but in the extended mind humanity, the  human blockchain. 

Stevens, no doubt, spent hours designing contracts and the assessing costs and benefits of economic design patterns. He thought about things like the arbitration, jurisdiction, money, finacial claims, and escrow. But actually, in his prose essays and journals, Stevens was notably mute about his day-to-day professional life. 

"The language we use around money is telling. Words like 'currency,'' 'tender,'' 'exchange' bespeak a world of social interaction, trust."

In a later essay, Stevens does call money “a kind of poetry.” 

In the crypto world, there is an ideological jump of faith to be made -- that of accepting the subjective value of money --- for it to make any sense. Stevens, a formulator of contracts, and man deeply steeped in practicality as well as ideology, knew this duality well. As *NY Times*reporter Quentin Hardy put it, Stevens "knew both sides of the coin, when he said how closely the real and the imaginary need each other for society to work." [2] 

Stevens encouraged us to look at "the power of the mind over the possibility of things". Many an effusive proponent of blckchain technology can be said to push the same motto. Indeed, crypto-minded thinkers might benefit from reading Stevens' 1944 collection *Harmonium*. 

Of course we would be neglectful if we didn't mention that the most poetic of the bunch, in contrast, may instead benefit from studying the historical features of the contracting and assessing of surety bond insurance claims.
