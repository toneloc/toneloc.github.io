title: "What I've Been Reading in 2018"
date: 10 Oct 2018
draft: true
---
My reading year 02018 (taking a formatting cue from the Long Now Foundation) was one that started with and was lergely guided by a triology about Winston Churchill. I was biased against a pile of thick and musty books about Churchill. I had thought that a trilogy about his life would be stale. *The Last Lion*, by prolific Aenerican journalist William Manchester, had come recommended. So I dug in. I was not disappointed. Manchester's trilogy is splendid. His writing is fresh, and so are Churchill's oft-quoted excogitations. But Churchill's life is simply astounding. That one man could do so much, write so much, and, in his twilight years, stand alone against the onslaught of the mighty Reich ... the whole arc of the narrative is remarkable.

It's interesting to note how Manchester sliced up Churchill's life into three volumes. The first volume goes from Churchill's birth in 1874, through his rebellious childhood, through his time at Sandhurst, through his fearless forays to warzones in India and South Africa and Sudan and Cuba, through his daring escape in the Boer War, through his early journalistic success, through his early poltical career as a progressive, through his conversion to Tory from Liberal, through his time as head of the Admiralty ahead of Great War, through the disastrous and deadly campaign in the Dardenelles, through his dismissal from the War Cabinet, throught his voluntary service in the trenches in Belgium, through his political revival after the war, through his time as Minister of Foreign Affairs, through his collaboration with Michael Collins and his handling of the Irish question, through his time as Chancellor of the Exchequer, through his defense of British dominion over India ... right up to his political exile in 1932. 

That is, the first book, two more to go, covers the first 58 years of Winston Spencer Churchill's life. 

The second book covers only eight--1932 to 1940. It is subtitled, simply, "Alone." To Manchester, this period is Churchill's finest hour. Churchill was out of government. He spent his time writing and painting and, often, remonstrating. Churchill knew of Hitler very on, and he despised the man. He despised that the British aristocracy was cozy with the Nazi regime. He despised appeasement. He dispeased the Munich agreeement. He spoke out aginst these atrocities, with persistence and with eloquence. 

Had he been heeded, WWII might not have happened. As it happened, it did, and the final tale is told with great eoloquence by Paul Reid, who took over the effort after William Manchester's death in 2011. I would have liked to have seen Manchester finish the volume, but strokes tragically muddled Manchester's mind. 


I loved the Churchill books, which got me on a kick about World War II. I was curious about the Pacific theater. Manchester himself served in the Pacific theater. Many years later, he wrote an excellent memoir about his time in the Marines, *Good-Bye, Darkness*. While Manchester himself served on Okinawa, he profiles the notable battles of the Pacific theater and visits the islands now (this was in the late 1970s). Some of the stories told in the novel are so gruesome, so unexepected, so heart-wrending, that they capture the boredom and confusion and bursts of extreme violence that was warfare in World War II. 

*With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa* is another Pacific War memoir, by native Alabaman E.L. Sledge. Sledge's account -- plain, violent, stirring -- was partially the inspiration for Tom Hanks' HBO miniseries *The Pacific*. It was pretty good, but I liked Manchester's overview better. I also devoured Laura Hillenbrand's *Unbroken*, an incredible story of survival. The story starts with a faulty B-24 and 47 starved days on a raft surrounded by sharks. It gets worse from there. 

In other WWII words, I read a lot by Ben MacIntyre, a British writer whose themes are unabashedly and delightfully British. *Rogue Heroes: The History of the SAS, Britain's Secret Special Forces Unit* is especially notable. I picked this gem up on a whim from a used bookstore, and was pleased with the purchase. The story told is of the formation of the SAS during the war in North Africa in 1941. Recently declassified files tell the stories for the first time. Britsh derrring-do is on display at its finest here: attacking fuel dumps in the middle of the night after marathon Jeep rides, blowing up row after row of Italian warplanes deep behind enemey territory, pretending to be German officers and cruising right through enemy checkpoints. There is humor and tragedy here in abundance. 34 of the 55 young men--they were very young--died, were wounded, or were captured on the SAS's very first mission. Perhaps as a coping mechanism, perhaps as a show of British understatedness, the men tried their best to come across as fearless. Nightime raids were called "jollies" or "parties." The book makes you forget aboutt he immense tragedy of the general goings-on. But even in war, there are, it seems, those men--call them insane or stupid or brave-- or who seek out the most dangerous missions to seek out the enemy and destroy him. The SAS's motto, "He who dares wins," as inscribed by its fearless leader Lt. Col. David Stirling, wraps up the SAS' WWII success in a nifty few words. The narrative moves swiftly, and one wishes the book were longer. 


I then quickly read a few other books by MacIntyre: *A Spy Among Friends: Kim Philby and the Great Betrayal*, *Agent Zigzag: A True Story of Nazi Espionage, Love, and Betrayal*, and *Operation Mincemeat: The True Spy Story that Changed the Course of World War II*. Forgive MacIntyre the wordy subtitles; his books are history regaled at its finest. 

Never had I understood the magnitude of the Philby deceptions, which went on for decades.  Philby was the most disastrous spy in British history, and the most successful in Soviet history. Philby was chief liason for the British M16 in Washington D.C. He likely thwarted CIA-sponsored missions in Albania and __


What's especially remakable about the tale is that he was once suspected of treason in the early 1950s. after an investigation, no evidence was found (Philby was a meticulous spy) and he was let back into the Brisih M16 and sent to Beirut. 

The ZigZag book was good, but had some filler. Likewise with the Mincemeat book. What, to me, is rather entertaining about the book are the characters who are seemingly culled from Bond books or 



The Last Lion also got me on a kick to read most of the stuff by William Manchester. Manchester, like his mentor H.L. Mencken, had a way with words. Words splashed and sizzled and



*Glory and the Dream: 1932-1972*, and eleven hundred-page brick. I must admit that I only made it to the Bah√≠a de Cochinos, that is, Bay of Pigs invasion, around the middle of 1961. 

But Manchester has a way of telling stories that illuminate the present through the telling of the past. 




Another theme that ran through 2018. 
Wizard and Prophet, by Mann

I review it here.

World Only Lit by Fire

Disturber of the Peace by Manchester. Mencken was a clever writer, and a serious scholar of the American English as distinct from Brisith English. 

Glory and the Dream


Pricing the Planet


Another theme that ran through 2018 was the Philosophy of Science. I had read Kuhn before.

The Open Society and Its Enemies

Popper vs. Kuhn: Battle for the Soul of Science







Americana by Bhu Srinivasan

The Mayflower was a venture gamble. 

I liken it to Prof. Robert Gordon's account of the American economy since 1870 for sheet factual might. But unlike Gordon, who argues that economic growth has slowed since 1970 because the productivty boosts from "one-time" inventions, such as the automobile, have exhausted themselves. 

Bhu seems to be an optimist. 


 or Deirdre McCloskey's *Bourgeois* trilogy, 


Srinivasan doesn't add much editorial zest to the analyis. Unlike R. Gordon or D. McCloskey, there is no guding theme. This is 


Factfulness by Rosling is another book that 

The Swede tells interpserses the data with intriguing tidbits from his fmailty history and Swedish family. 

*Factfulness* by Hans Rosling is a joy to read. Succinct and salient advice for a progressive and international worldview: 
- small change is still change - beware the urgency instinct (we must *do* something!)
- always check for largest and smallest values in data sets

For example, Monaco occupies a couple o columns in the alamance, and India spans a few columbs too. But who cares about Moncado?

I reckon it is similiar to *The Myth of Continents*, w







Tooze

Tooze gets into the strategic nitty-gritty, for better or worse. This book is more about geo-politics then economics. But as Tooze points out, given the unprecendented inteference by state-sponosored financial actors-- central banks, regulators, multierlateral orgs like the Europena commmission, NATO -- 



On Designer People

I'm concerned about the tendency of omnipresent images, surveillance, and political correctness to make, like a cookie-cutter, a most drab and conformist population out of the outlandish stuff of human nature and thought. 

In a wonderful interview in 1974 with Michael Parkinson, Jacob Bronowski has a telling segment regarding the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, a famous fan of the drink. Bronowski knew Dylan Thomas rather well. Parkinson asked whether Bronowski, a buttoned-up mathmatician, ever regretted not living the Bohemian life of a poet like Thomas. 

"Of course I regret hving never have written poems as beautiful as Dylan Thomas," Bronowski quipped. The dialogue continued:

*

Michael Parkinson: But then, well what about the irresponsibility, if one can put it, of the poet like Thomas, because although he lived in this style and created this magnificent poetry, he also killed himself, didn't he, by doing it?

Bronowski: Well that was his look-out. [Nervous laughter from the audience]

Parkinson: Doesn't he have a responsibility to those around him who love him too?

Bronnoski: I think they accepted him for what he was; he really was a very splendid person. Of course I was very sorry when he killed himself, for what seemed to me ridiculous reasons. *But you know, people are of a piece. You can't think that you can go around in a kleptomaniac way like a shoplifter in the Almighty Supermarket, picking out something that you like here: "Oh I'll have a little brain there" and so on* ... I'm reminded of McCarthy and the Committee for Un-American Activities when I was in America back in 1953 who kept on having great scientists in front of him and would say to them: "We understand about your being a great scientist, but why are you such a radical in politics? Couldn't you be a nice conservative like me and Mr. Nixon [Audience laughter]. 

And one couldn't explain to them that being a scientist, and being a poet, being an orignal person, meant a very questioning, a very rebellious, and very uncomfortable way of life. And that's what makes progress in the human race.

*

(italics added)

Bronowski's answer, from a man born in 1908, differs from what would have been given in 2018. The answer, in 2018, would have focused on the negative aspects of Thomas' alcoholism: "He was torubled man. He should have gotten help. He let too soon." 

Bronowski admits that, well, yes, this is true, but what is an outlet of self-hurt in one manner or is an outrage to society at the time, can in another manner be an outlet of self-expression. We can't have Lincoln without his depression. We can't have Churchill without the brandy in his bloodstream and the cigar in his mouth. We can't have Picasso without the womanizing. We can't have Da Vinci without his homosexuality. 


If one mistakes costs 


Bronowski concludes his response above by noting that here gives a 
adventurous strain

Enlightnelment Now by pinker


I liked this book. It coved the geopolitical trends in the past 10 years across the world. All the countries and thigns are examined: the invasion of Georgia by Russia in 2008, South Korean stimulus plan, the biggest response of all by the Chinese ....

- dollar-centric world will have issues

- US bailed out AIG, which bailed out Europe. London was the big casino. 
- ‚ÄúThe Fed, without public consultation of any kind, made itself into a lender of last resort for the world,‚Äù Mr. Tooze writes.

The world-wide economic crisis, Mr. Tooze argues, would have been far less severe had governments raced to pump money into their economies. It was China, he notes, that first acted in such a way to forestall an economic downturn in the autumn of 2008. ""
made up shit


 It takes a pretty holitics view of the economy, but always seemed to hearken back to the decisionmakers and the elite. For Tooze, the global econonomy is like a complex machine with thousands of levers: fiscal policy, stimuls spending, stock prices of banks,etc . ___



Tooze's statist tendencies show themselves in his seemmingly arbitrary commendation of some of the configurations of these levers, while disdaining  others. 



For example, he notes that to all but the "freshwater" economists, the simulus plan of 2009 worked. He noted that Obama "brutally" put down Christina Romer's suggestion that the simulus package could, or should, have been twice as large. 
I can only imagine that Romer avoided having been waterboarded.

This seems intuitive. If, like Mr. Tooze, we treat the series of crises that include the failure of Lehman Brothers and cascaded through the eurozone as a single event, then this was the worst economic catastrophe since the Great Depression. And since the Depression led to political convulsions like nationalism and fascism, shouldn‚Äôt this one?
