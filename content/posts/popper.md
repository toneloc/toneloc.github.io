Karl Popper's intellectual achievements lie mostly in his twofold defense of human reasonableness. Notice that I did not use the term often associated with Popper, "raionality" or "critical rationality."



The first leg of his defense is his vivid description and defense of the Open Society, in the eponymous book published 1945. Popper framed the values that 

He achieved widespread fame upon publishing The Open Society and Its Discontents in 1945. Popper notes that what ""

Popper would have known about the enemies: a Jew, he was banished from Hitler's Germany in the 30s

On a more general note, more than most philosophers of science like Kuhn and the radical Paul Feyerbend


There is much to admire in the figure of Karl Popper, the great Austrian philsopher. Popper more than anyone else in the 20th Century (including Thomas Kuhn) was ahead of the curve with regard to 

>First thesis: We know a great deal. And we know not only many details of doubtful intellectual interest, but also things which are of considerable practical significance, and what is even more important, which provide us with deep theoretical insight, and with a surprising understanding of the world.

>Second thesis: Our ignorance is sobering and boundless. Indeed, it is precisely the stagget progress of the naturanl sciences (to which my first thesis alludes) which constantly opesn our eyes anew to ignorance, even in the field of naurnace sciences themselves. This gives a new twist to the Socratic ideal of ignorance.

This author has something else in common with Popper, having spent some time in Christchurch, New Zealand at the University of Canterbury. It was there that Popper wrote *The Open Society and its Enemies*.

Popper's intellectual biography, aptly entitled *Unending Quest* includes fascinating vignettes from his experiences with the Who's Who of mid-twentieth century thought-makers. There was the time in Princeton when Popper tried to convince Einstein to give up his determinism, which "amounted to the view that the world was a four-dimensional Parminidean block universe in which change was a human illusian (or very nearly so)."
