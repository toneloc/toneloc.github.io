title: "Theses of Reasonableness: Sir Karl Popper and the Unended Quest for the Open Society"

Having studied Popper off and on for some time, I'm time and again intrigued by how the man applied a central tenet of reasonableness to disparate subjects as quantum physics, psychology, and social planning. I suggest that Karl Popper's intellectual achievements lie mostly in his twofold defense of human reasonableness against the tyranny of authoritarianism and unquestioned tradition. 

Notice that I did not use the term often associated with Popper, "rationality" or, the particular brand of philosophy which he has come to be know for, "critical rationality." Popper is no doubt a rational thinker. He couldn't have carried on close personal relationships with friends like Einstein, Kurt Godel, Freidrich von Hayek, and E.M. Gombrich if he were not a supremely rational thinker. But in Popper we see an ambiguity of thought, and a richness of context and an understanding of the limits of rationality that is notably lacking from who he would claim are the enemies of his open society: Plato, Hegel, Marx, and those who fashion their times (and often themselves) as a fabled and necessary consequence of the unfounding events of history. 

Popper was no fan of history. It had no "meaning" he would say []. For history had been crafted out of an infinite panoply of facts and possibilities, and to the resulting splash of happenstance we cannot meaningfully craft an arc of narrative; and we are absurd and dangerous when we try to do so.

Plato, it should be remembered, called for something quite opposite of an open and democratic society; he called for rule of the philsopher-kings as guardians of the state. Plato crafted his

On a more general note, more than most philosophers of science like Kuhn and the radical Paul Feyerbend


There is much to admire in the figure of Karl Popper, the great Austrian philsopher. Popper more than anyone else in the 20th Century (including Thomas Kuhn) was ahead of the curve with regard to 

>First thesis: We know a great deal. And we know not only many details of doubtful intellectual interest, but also things which are of considerable practical significance, and what is even more important, which provide us with deep theoretical insight, and with a surprising understanding of the world.

>Second thesis: Our ignorance is sobering and boundless. Indeed, it is precisely the stagget progress of the naturanl sciences (to which my first thesis alludes) which constantly opesn our eyes anew to ignorance, even in the field of naurnace sciences themselves. This gives a new twist to the Socratic ideal of ignorance. With each step forward, with each probelm which we solve, we not only discover new and unsolved problmes, but we also discover that where we believed we were standing on firm and safe ground, all things are, in truth, insecure and in a state of flux.


This author has something else in common with Popper, having spent some time in Christchurch, New Zealand at the University of Canterbury. It was there that Popper wrote *The Open Society and its Enemies*.

Popper's intellectual biography, aptly entitled *Unending Quest* includes fascinating vignettes from his experiences with the Who's Who of mid-twentieth century thought-makers. There was the time in Princeton when Popper tried to convince Einstein to give up his determinism, which "amounted to the view that the world was a four-dimensional Parminidean block universe in which change was a human illusian (or very nearly so)." (See: [Parmenides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides))

However, Popper was no -do-as-you-please libertarian. Notably, in a 1994 interview shortly before his death, Popper lambasted the sad state of television, and called for its self-regulation. One can only presume that Popper would have abhorred the throbbing masses of online media and the quasi-nihilist appreciation of truth in the clickbait Trump era.
