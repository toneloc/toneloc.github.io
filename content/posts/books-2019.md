2019 was a year of some great reads, some expected gems, and some fun surprises.

Two great reads were <b>*Boy</b>* and <b>*Going Solo</b>*, remarkable memoirs by Roald Dahl. Dahl can spin a yarn--remember Wonka, the BFG, the giant Peach  and what a life he lived. Summers in Norway, where his familty was from, and deadly forays against the Luftwaffe in World War II. It is a miracle he survived to pen his classic children's books. Most British figher pilots died of bullets, fire, or impact. But Dahl's straightforward and thrilling real-life tales underplay the tragedy in favor of the overall story.

An expected gem was Deirdre McCloskey' "Why Liberalism Works: How True Liberal Values Produce a Freer, More Equal, Prosperous World for All." The book is a collection of her snappy interviews, articles and blog pieces. Several chapters critique Thomas Piketty on grounds that: (a) his own data only shows that inequality was shown to raise in the USA, England, and France (I believe); (2) the the arithmetic of redistribution does not remotely compare with the gains brought about by the natural course of innovation, trial, and error; and (3) that, after all, most of us would agree that most of the poort live in authoritarian or inept political reguimes. How could more of that solve the ills of the masses? 

"Alchemy" by Ogilby ad executive Rory Sutherland was another unexepcted gem. The book, in my opinion, was much more effective than any of the behavioral economists I have read. In fact, I do not like term "behavioral economics." It misses the fact that, prima facie, economics is behavioral. With no human behavior there is no economics.

<b>*Nature's Metropolis*</b> by William Cronon was a good book, one which chronicles the City of Chicago's great boom years from 1870-1900. The boom was brought on by the Midwestern bounty: timber from Wisconsin was cut in winter and floated down spring-rushed rivers to the Chicago sawmills; grain from the surrounding flatlands was milled; and hogs and cattle from all around were shipped on the freshly cast railroads. Of special interest to me is the banking and financing apparatus that grew around Nature's Metropolis Cronon is a history professor at U. Wisconsin-Madison, and he's clearly done his research. A recommended tome on economics history and the history of Chicago, though one wishes it were slightly slimmer. 

A fun surprise, my most recent book, was David Foster Wallace's collection of book readings and radio interviews "In His Own Words." Foster has a talent for _____ often it's stories within stories, and the , who killed himself in 2007, all the more post-modern and eerie and ___

<b>*A Truck Full of Money</b>* was a fun and lively too, read, written by longtime tech describer Tracey Kidder. I love Kidder's simple words and lack of editorializing. The subject, Kayak.com founder Paul English, is presented as-is. "As-is" isn't always pretty--at times the English is manic or grandiose and in fact, the man is open about his difficulties with bipolarity. But that all adds to the contrast betwen the seriousness of English's entrepreneurial efforts, and success, and the flamboyance of the means. The book reminds you of the dual aspects of personality, especially as applied to entrepreneurs. Take disagreeableness with most of humanityfor example  ... well is not a desirable trait, but you had better disagree with most people about your liklihood of success, because, objectively speaking, it's not high. 

<b>*The Dream Machine</b>* about the irrepressible JCR Licklider, he who was the internet dreamer-of. Well, I didn't so irrepressibly read the book; I made it about half way.  <b>*Hayek on Liberty</b>* by John Gray was a serious academic effort and took me a while to get through. I was especially interested in Gray's crtiques of Haykek, which I would like to revist. <b>*Bitcoin Billionaire</b>* by Mezrich made me change my mind about the Winklevii twins. Their spectacularly successful bitcoin investments saw them make out like bandits. The Winklevii still do come across as somewhat uninspiring, but the seriousness of the effort and sometimes the brilliance of the execution (as in when the twins go on a transcontinental voyage to secure their cryptographic private keys in bank safety deposity boxes.) Mezrich's tale about the personalities around the absurd world of bitcoin are sure to entertain thos interested in the spce. 

<b>*Out of the Gobi</b>* was a fascinating book about China in the 1970s and 1980s. Weijian Shan tells a wild story about China before and during the Cultural Revoltion. The author laments the waste of life, effort, and creativity. The words are simple and stoic--perhaps too stoic, about the famine that killed tens of millions and turned out to be one of the great humanitarian tragedies of the 20th Century. The author goes to the Gobi on a collective farm; the crop yields are tragic, but the story is great. I can hardly critique a memoir for being too focused on the details. After all, hardly anyone in China knew the destruction that Mao's plans were bringing about. And the details of the story are remarkable. 

<b>*China's Economy</b>* by Arthur Kroeber was great book about China that I would read again. Kroeber is at the Brookings Institution and lies to rest some misinformation about China. Particularly intersting was Kroeber's thougths on China's debt problems: not much of a problem, all considered. I was interested in this because of another book <b>*China's Great Wall of Debt</b>* which argued that China's boom had bee fueled by foolhardy investments brought on by mounumentally dumb policy intervetions. Kroeber seems to suggest that China's sheer size and potential for growth render this claim unreasonably severe. Not sure which side I would bet, but I lean towards more concern.  

<b>*A Mind at Play</b>* by Goodman and Soni about Claude Shannon was really interesting, mainly for its long segues about the nature of information, What is inforamtion? Is it the absence of nothing (noise) or the absence of randomness--and is the absence of randomness, essentially, signal)? Neither can be wholly true. Shannon was a playful genius.

<b>*House of Morgan</b>* was about the august and internatioanl firm of JP Morgan for over a century and up to around 1990. The firm introduced a number of innovations, spawned or financed a number of iconic brands, and and was worldy from the start. The firm has its first roots in London, not New York. The bank was not without its blemishes, however. Longtime legendary chairman Tom Lamont, for example, made a terrible mistake kowtowing to Mussolini in the 1930s. IN other econmomics history, or more like it, moral philosophy, <b>*How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life</b>* was a bit bland, but short, book about the moral philosopher and the first economist. 2019 also saw more of a dive deep into the "Theory of Moral Sentiments" by Adam Smith.

<b>*Revolt of the Public</b>* by Martin Gurri about how technology has given the public an irreversible look into the conduct of persons of authority: policticans, big business, and so on. How can authority hold up when the Wizards of Oz have their curtains pulled back? A bit of a stretch, Gurri's claim, unsupported by causal evidence as it is. But what keeps it going is that you think it is an honest assessment and also, frankly, makes a lot of sense. <b>*Quartered Safe out Here</b>* was so splendidly told by George Macdonald Fraser. It's about a unit of troops serving in the horrific conditions of the tropical Pacific, with starved Japanese men trying to kill them at every turn. The men go to hell and some never come back. <b>*Abraham Lincoln</b>*

Finance books were read. <b>*Bitcoin Standard</b>* was great for those who are amenable to alternate theories of finance. I read the whole thing quickly, but I think the evidence could have been tighter. I would have appreciated Saifedean Ammous' effort more on economic indicators and technical indicators about why bitcoin could succeed--andd was hoping he would opine less on, say, the immorality of modern art. <b>*The Man Who Solved the Market</b>* was about Jim Simons and Rennaissance Capital, whose Medalion Fund is one of the most successful hedge funds ever.  <b>The Spider Network</b> was about LIBOR manipulation by traders and the autistic trader who was in large part responsible and in who large part was scapegoated. 


<b>A Splendid Exchange</b> by Berstein focused too much on Ancient commerce, and too little on the more dynamic past several centuries. <b>The Path to Power</b>Lyndon Johnson has a ridiculous and outsized I dip in and out of this one. 

A few spy books, and lots of crypotography reading. 
Other books include 

Merry Christmas!
