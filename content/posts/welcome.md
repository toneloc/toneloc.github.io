Dear reader, 

Thanks for visiting my blog and welcome. I plan to write about economic history, art, the history of ideas, crypto systems, and whatever else comes to mind. Feel free to contact me [@tonklaus](https://twitter.com/tonklaus).

Special thanks to the author of [this useful tutorial](https://fillmem.com/post/fast-secured-and-free-static-site/) about creating websites with Hugo, a Go app that generates static websites like this one.

Cheers,
Tony
