title: "Steven Stoll's 'Ramp Hollow: The Ordeal of Appalachia' review and some thoughts on Marxist historicism"
date: 10 Nov 2018
draft: true
---
It's evident from reading *Ramp Hollow: The Ordeal of Applachia* by Fordham University history professor Steven Stoll that Mr. Stoll cares deeply about Applachia. Stoll explains with great empathy how the "household mode of production" -- plot farming, a few livestock, selling just a little surplus -- allowed for the people of West Virginia to enjoy more consistent sustenance that, say, the wages of Big Coal and its capitalist vagaries. 

Stoll's tells a big story about the forcible taking of the land by the powerful (*dispossession* he calls it). The story, he says starts with English enclosure, which is just what it sounds like: the fencing off of what were previosuly common pastures. Stoll says that the lessons we can learn there ___ apply to Appalachia and __

another one _____




Unlike Mr. Stoll, I do not care so much about Applachia, not West Virginia or Kentucky. Nor do I care about Canada or China. I do care about the *people* of these places, insofar as they are domiciled there at any given time. But unlike Mr. Stoll's deeply pessimistic book, the story I see from the perspective of the poor is a story of continuous, almost miraculous betterment. This betterment was not brought about by "capital." Typical for the Marxist, Stoll plays fast and loose with the word “capital.” Stoll notes that people "who lack government protection" are "subject to capital" (pg. 286), as though capital is a masked intruder in the night. Tell the Venezualan in 2018 who, at the whim of an authoritarian socialist government, can have her "capital" -- be it a house or savings -- snatched away. 





For Marxists like Stoll or Terry Eagleton or Thomas Piketty, "capital" an elusive catch-all, a straw man, a scapegoat, all at once. Marxists treat capital as if it is some evil amorphous goo that sticks to those who happen to come in contact with it, not understanding any business investment is fraught with anxious risk for the entrepreneur. Stoll admits that recently some coal companies have gone out of business. 






Stoll suggests that the most "unsettling currents" in an alternative account of Applachia's problems, J.D. Vance's *Hillybilly Elegy*, "like in the necessity of leaving" (pg. 278)

"the role of public policy and a politcal solution is to help everyone in the same situation" (pg. 278)




For a Marxist, Stoll has an odd regard for the Rosseau's noble savage, the idea of self-determination and self-subsistence ...


>>>> chief ARGUMENT

"One of the basic insights of political ecology is that povety is not the lack of things that people had never had known but a social relation in which people are deprived of the means of subsistence" (pg. 256). 
-> here is the core ethical question of the book, one that Stoll comes too often, but doesn't seem to want to parse apart. 

is it better to reduce aboslutel opverty or relative poverty? ....



Herein is the chief rhetorical trick that Stoll plays. Stoll seems to want to argue that if the poor of West Virginia were free for the past century to keep there land to be able to forage and grow tomatoes and compost and hunt, then they would be in a better state today. Stoll does not wish to consider, even, that impoverished smallholders might wish voluntarily to sell their land to a coal company or move to Texas or that, God forbid, they might even prefer to work in a coal mine than work a spade. 


Stoll similarly does not wish to consider the plain fact that absolute poverty has decreased repaidly, even in Appalachia, even in Mexico and the Phillipines. Instead, Stoll wants to debate on purely intellectual grounds in the realm of relative poverty, with his Grand Story of Exploitation taking front and center. 

Stoll suggests that "if corporations pursuing their objectives through free trade over the last one hundred years really spreadwelath wherever they went, there would be no Global Scum of 1 billion people" and that "the spatial managestation of capital in the twenty-first century ... "[is] an archipelago of misery that is the mirror image of the wealth created by disposession." Au contraire, Prof. Stoll. First, those who live in the slums often choose to do so to have access to the opporunities of the nearby city. And second, as Deirdre McCloskey notes, "That even over the long run there remain some poor people does not mean the system is not working for the poor, so long as their condition is continuing to improve, as it is, and so long as the percentage of the desperately poor is heading toward zero, as it is. That people still sometimes die in hospitals does not mean that medicine is to be replaced by witch doctors"


Stoll does not want to consider that since the coal companies have moved in  1900, life expectancy has increased from  o. Some exploitation.


frigid, pneumatic winters and humid, malarial summers ...

Not that the coal companies themselves caused the increase in welath. Perhaps they did not contirbute at all, or, as Stoll claims, they decrease quality of life. But it is not just coal. It is rather the liberal idea of the worth of the smallholder wishing to explore an entreprenuerial opporunity.




^^^ DECENTRALIZED NATURE OF DEVELOPMENT
Stoll is is strongest when considering that the centralized rule-making, especially the corruption, bribery and nepotism that has manifested itself in every culture all of human history, works againts the goals of ____


The growth story is not all there is. Stoll’s argument is strongest when we consider the destructive effects of centralization on self-sufficiency and 



Stoll is also wise to question the wisdom of experts sticking their noses in the business of other economies. 

Even a figure such as "employment" and "unemployment" is not evident. Should household production, child care, or volunteer work count as employment? The ways that people can interact economically are diverse and we should not prize the moneyed type over the other type. 


Stoll is probably right that traditional economic thinking does not apply to "the household mode of produciton," which is itself a unit of end-state consumption. 


^^^ DECENTRALIZED NATURE OF DEVELOPMENT

But Stoll's nuanced appreciation of the imporance of decentralized development too often lapses into nonsensical romantic assertions such "when people take care of landscapes, landscapes take care of them.” Tell that to the Irish potato farmer in 1841. Or else Marxist topsy-turvyism as "When people buy and sell commodities, they appear to but working for their own betterment even if they are really satisfying the imperatives set by others." (pg.64-64) Ah yes, thank you Prof. Stoll for making it clear that when I buy my coffee, I am at root at the behest of Starbucks.



Stoll’s Marxist interpretation misses the forest of innovation for the fossilized tree. In fact, Stoll's thinking is fossilized in the past. Stoll seems to excoriate one hsitoricist and foolish grand theory, that of the the Great Law of Economic Progress, with his preferred grand story, that of the Exploitation of the Poor and the Rural. Both are wrong.



The myth of the nobel savage plays a central role.


Tell that to the Scots Irish population of the 1700s in, say, Ulster or Kerry. "The response to your enduring poverty needs to be *social*" 

Do the Irish lament that they lost 40% of their population ??



Sixty years later, that

Stoll's vision is a pathetic vision of the human condition, in the Greek sense. We should *feel* says the Marxist scholar like Stoll.  But Polio was not cured by the subsistence of the agrarian farmer. 


hands off my tradition!

Stoll notes that since 1952, the population of West Virginia has decreased by a stunning 40%. This, on a same time frame where the population of Texas increased seven-fold. I for one, am pleased with the displacement. Good for the 40%. How are they and their children and grandchildren are faring now, in, say, Houston and L.A.? Perhaps even more should leave, as Vance would advocate. Easy for me to say; Stoll suggests that they may not have the money for a tank of gas. But surely they have more than their illiterate and starving ancestors had when they left Ireland and sailed the Atlantic in creaking wooden ships. 





An issue with digesting the West Virginia story is that the costs are so centralized (in one state, even!), yet the benefits (electricity) so widespread. Here the Marxist resembles Trump. When the costs can be rhetorically localized (Trump on closed factories), the story disguises the overwhelming benefits that more widely accrue (lower costs from free trade). We can see the coal smeared on the face of the downtrodden miner, but we look right past the lightbulb that in 1930 let a young ___ read. Electricity, of course, was the primary benefit of the extractive industry of coal, and at accrued for the masses, not fourth Rolex on the Peabody great-grandson. 



The environmental costs are severe,  but we must weight these also against its benefits. Had we had to burn wood for fuel, we would’ve cleared the trees even faster than strip mining. 



and there are myriad forms of “capital” to deal with is: venture funding, bank loans, personal loans, 

Coal companies, believe it or not, can lose money, and they did when 




 Literacy is up from ___ to __ (“But schoolchildren will never know the pleasure of foraging!”). And I cannot know for sure, but I suppose that in Wes Virginia 2018 is a better time than 1918 to be poor, a woman, divorced, gay,  or black. Stoll’s



The story of this progress can be found in a word which not once, tellingly, appears in Mr. Stoll’s book: *innovation*. Yes, even up in the hollers.  hillbillies have benefitted from plastic, microwaves, refrigeration, TVs, insulin, chemotherapy, and ____. Coal was worthless until we realized it could be burned for heating, mechanism enery, and electricity. People, freed from the ancient trammels of hierarchical deference to the nobility, racism, sexism, 




Romanaticized notion of the self-sufficient hillbilly. What year of tefchnology  is the ideal of the Kibbutz-like community living that Stoll purports to enact? Ought they to use nitrogen fertilizer, or ATVs or sprinkler systems? 



Stoll says thae "Enclosure, more than any other of capitalism's defining practices, embodies its historical patterns and enabling assumptions." Stoll’s stylized history of British enclosure—that it led to "starvation and poverty" (pg. 48)—is likely wrong.  Population increased after enclosure, and so did yields. We may conclude that the dimensions of fences mattered very much indeed from a distribution of wealth,



Dispossession offends our sensibilities, as it should. But the culprit is not human greed in all its vulgarity, but rather
