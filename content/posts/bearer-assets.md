In Obermaier's the Panama Papers, an amusing anecdote

In the late 1990s, Joachim zu Baldernach -- who's not really called that -- finds himself unable to locate his Bahamas-based company. Strictly speaking, Baldernach, wh comes from a familty of billionaires, hasn't actually misplaced the company, but rather the anonymous bearer share for all 5,000 shares of the shell company, which was established in the 1990s. But the bearer share is, effectively, the company. Offshore companies rarertly have offices or employees; the don't usually even have their own letterbox. So Baldernach rather reluctantly sends a fax to the Mossack Fonseca [a Panama-based law firm that sets up offshore shell companies for wealthy clients, and who was the victim of a a multiterabyte data breach in 2016] branch in the Bahamas, enquiring how he can get a new bearer share. The problem for Mossfon is that there' s no way of knowing whtyher Baldernach hasn't actually sold, lent, or pledged his share, and with it the company. After all, that's why anonymous bearer shares are so sought after by shady operators: you can sell your offshore company at any time without leaving a trace. 

So what would happen if Mossack Fonseca were to issue a new bearer share for all 5,000 shares, only for someone to turn up the next day with the original, missing certificate? That someone would then be the legal owner of the offshore company. [I]n the end, Joachim zu Baldernach signs a letter of indemnity for Mossack Fonseca. In it, Baldrenach asserts that he has not transferred, lent, or in any other way used the share, and Mossfon is released from any liability risk that could potentially arise in connection with the new share.
