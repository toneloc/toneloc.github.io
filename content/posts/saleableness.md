title: "Measures of liquidity"

Carl Menger, when describing the origin of money, used a good term: "saleableness" (in German)  or the ability of something to be sold. Commodities like gold and silver, Menger maintained 150 years ago, had the best saleableness. Thus, it became currency. 

"Saleableness" is a better term than the bland and unthinking "liquidity". "Liquidity", in financial parlance, often means simply, "the ability to trade an asset for cash." Yet, there is a subtle and subterfuging assumption in the definition of liquidity as "the ability to trade an assset for cash" -- namely the assumption that cash itself is the paragon of liquidity. I will argue this assumption is harmful and mistaken, and moreover, symptomatic of the state of monetary thinking hear in the post Bretton-Woods era of monetary policy and bank regulation.

The most liquid asset in the world, most finance gurus would agree, is the United States dollar and short-term U.S. government bonds. This is hard to argue with. The U.S. dollar has enjoyed a low and steady rate of inflation for several decades. The U.S. military is the strongest; the U.S. economy a behemoth; US well-respected among nations. The US Federal Reserve has maintained an aura of independence from politics, deservedly or not. Many international financial agreements choose the US Southern District of Manhattan as their jurisdiction. In some countries, the U.S. dollar is the de facto currency. Other nations like Singapore have their unit of currency pegged to the US dollar. Air drop me in a random country on Earth and I'd probably most like to have a wad of dollars to work with, as opposed, say, a nominally more valubale gold medallion. 

The concept of liquidity-as-cash is the very basis of financial regulation. Basel rules, set forth by the Bank of International settlements, mandate that banks maintain certain percentages of short-term assets, such as cash and short-term government bonds, alongside certain percentages of riskier long-term assets, such as corporate bonds and stocks. Taxes must be paid in local currency, and courts will adjudicate damages in local currency. 

So what have we learned? First, that liquidity means "the ability of an asset to be sold for cash". Second, that the U.S. dollar and U.S. government bonds are rightfully considered in 2018 to be the most liquid assets available. And third, that the concept of liquidity-as-cash is the basis of bank-sector regulation.

This analysis is biased towards the present, as it should be: most of my readers will be in the present. But if we situate economic actors behind Rawlsian veil of ignorance across time and place, will the assessment that the still hold? If you were air dropped at random to a place from, say, the year 1800-1900, what asset would you most like to hold? Pound sterling? Gold? What if the time 

so that in say, the year 2050 when we I am again air-dropped into a random location on planet eart

What would be the asset we would want as an individual when emerging on the other side? nd what would the features of a globally accepted asset?

Well, as an individual, I might want something that:
- certainly will not decline in value (increasing in value is fine!)
- I can trade easily for something I actually want

As a group, we might want more neutral. We want something that:

It's interesting to note for this discussion that in the capital of Europe, Brussels,
everyone speaks English. And the United Kingdom is even attempting to withdraw from the EU! The reaspon for this is tha the lingua franca is not longer franca, but English. Gather an Estonian, a Croat, and a Spaniard, and if there is a language they speak in common, there is a 99% chance it is English. English has become the international standard.  

We know this not to be the case. Currency failures
