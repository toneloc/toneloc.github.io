In late 2011 and 2012 I spent several months as an intern in Brussels, Belgium. They have a special name for these interns in Brussels, <i>stagiaire</i>. All these years later, two episodes remain in my mind. I recall that when they occurred, I thought to myself, "Europe has no shot; this place is stagnant." The first episode happened immediately when I began my first internship at a lobbying firm. This occurred during graduate studies in public policy and economics.
