title: "Letter against tokenization"

The promise of tokenization of off-chain assets as scarce crypto-units is a tantalizing promise in the blockchain space. Organizations such as the DAO and various Ethereum-based token sales that raise a lot of money highlight the trend. Unfortunately, the idea that blockchain tokenization will be a transformative technological improvement is largely mistaken. The fallacy made here is thus: that the extremely high level of security that Bitcoin provides is extensible and desirable in many other areas of finance and accounting besides payments and settlement. In fact, this high level of security is not desirable at all.

The reason is because effective fault tolerance is already built into complex systems such as finance, taxation, and accounting through many generations of trial and error. 


Take as an example the idea of joint ownership of an international corporation. A large firm will have a variety of cash flows: direct sales, dividends paid from ownership of other companies, revenue from bond holdings, et cetera. An investment fund, insofar as it is a company made of other companies, may have even more diverse revenue streams. These revenue streams may accrue as periodic rent income dollars, direct sales yen, or stock dividends in euros. All of these revenue streams must be meticulously accounted for by highly specialized tax attorneys and accountants, per accounting regulations across the globe. 

The idea that we can meaningfully represent these ownership stakes as scarce crypto-unites is optimisitc at best. 


There are two main obstacles to the path of tokenization and smart contracts:

1. *Legal precendent* - Imagine an investor in a company loses the private keys controlling his or her tokens in a company. Do you think that a judge in Illinois will rule that said Investor has forfeited forever the revenue streams that token gave ownership to? Must we now instruct companies to burn the cash that represents that investor's invesment stake?
 

2. *The Fiat-to-Crypto Gateway* â€“ A related issue is the difficulty of translating 



The prospect of smart contracts to upset this bureaucracy, in the short term, is ridiculous. Consider how long in t

Obviously, there is nothing inherently new about the idea of representing ownership of revenue streams, brand identity, and other corporate assets as an abstract share.

There are millions of highly specialized business people, tax accountants, corporate attorneys, regulatory attorneys who handle the paperwork related to thes complex coporate arrangments.
